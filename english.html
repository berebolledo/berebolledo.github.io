						<h2>Bio</h2>
						<p> I majored in bioengineering in Chile, which led me to genomics and exploring ultraconserved enhancers in humans. However, regardless of how awesome working with molecular and cell biology tools was, I naturally leaned towards computational approaches to science. Fortunately, I was able to get further training thanks to a Fulbright scholarship and funding from Chile. So, in 2010, I moved to the USA and completed a PhD in Bioinformatics and Genomics at Penn State University, under the direction of
							<a href="https://nekrut.github.io/lab_site/"> Anton Nekrutenko </a> and 
							<a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/makova_lab/"> Kateryna Makova </a>. They ignited my interest for mitochondrial genomics, and motivated me to focus on generating reproducible bioinformatics research.
							
							<br> Now back home, I am in charge of our bioinformatics core facility, from where I can focus on facilitating the discovery of causal genetic variants in rare undiagnosed disorders, explore the involvement of mito-nuclear interactions in disease, and lead the implementation of known and novel pipelines for the analysis of sequencing data in health related problems.

							<h3>My research: Mitochondrial genomics</h3>
							<p>I spent six years of doctoral training working on a bioinformatics pipeline for the unequivocal identification of mtDNA heteroplasmic sites from sequencing data. Back then, the sequencing error rates were higher, so the identification of true low level heteroplasmies were difficult. The results were <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/43/15474"> published </a> in 2014, and served us to redefine the germline bottleneck, and show that children born to older mothers have more mitochondrial variants. 
							<br>Back in Chile, I continued working on mitochondrial genomics, but with a clinical twist. Thanks to a postdoctoral training grant (FONDECYT 3170280), I was able to explore the differences in the mitochondrial heteroplasmies transmission dynamics in mother-child pairs affected by 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The results were published <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12010092"> here</a>. Currently, our group has been funded  to explore the extent of inherited <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0766-1">mitonuclear discordance </a> among admixed individuals affected by congenital defects, immunological conditions and cancer (FONDECYT 11220642).

							<h3>My collabs: Decoding Complex Inherited Phenotypes of Rare Disorders (DECIPHERD)</h3>
							<p>Chile lags behind in the implementation of clinical genomics. So we started a research project aimed at 
							generating local expertise on: (1) next-generation sequencing (2) exome data analysis, and (3) providing an answer to local patients who have spent years
							in the health system trying to figure out the cause of their condition. The research team is a diverse group that involves clinicians, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, and lawyers, who are very motivated to develop the field locally and contribute internationally.
						<br> As the image shows, the patient is at the center of our efforts. Research, public policies, and clinical management, can all contribute to improving a patient's life.

							<h3>Extras: Bioinformatics Assistance Service</h3>
							<p> SABio stands for "Servicio de Asistencia en Bioinformática" in Spanish, but it also translates to "wise person". 
							We set up a cluster for high performance computing with the help of Chilean grant FONDEQUIP EQM150093. As such, it is a national resource available for local and external collaborators to use. SABio, thus acts as a consulting service, primarily aimed at helping trainees to design and complete their genomic analyses on the cluster.</p>
